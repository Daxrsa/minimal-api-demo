1.Explicit http client -> Register HTTPClient object 
                          explicitly in Dependency Injection Service: 
                          Not recommended because you cannot register 
                          more than one domain. 
2.Named Client -> Registering named clients 
                  with the 'IHttpClientFactory' service, 
                  which can then be injected into 
                  the minimal API endpoints or services.
3.Type Client ->  involves creating a typed class that represents 
                  the HTTP client and registering it as a named 
                  client with the HttpClient service.
4.HttpRequestMessage Object -> (Not recommended, there are better ways to implement this) 
                               technique that involves using HttpRequestMessage class.
